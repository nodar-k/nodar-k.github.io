Infectious Disease Epidemiologist

With a research focus on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, I apply mathematical modeling to discern transmission dynamics, assess vaccine effectiveness, and analyze the impact of waning immunity. I am dedicated to evaluating the success of public health interventions and understanding the broader implications of vaccine uptake and equity. These interests are anchored by a decade of experience leading global clinical programs within the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. I am experienced in using both dynamic network and compartmental models.
